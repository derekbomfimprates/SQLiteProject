# SQLiteProject

The hybrid framework React Native is used alongside NodeJS to develop applications mainly in the Android environment,
which enables the running of JavaScript on the server-side on the web environment.

In simple terms, the SQLite functionality in React Native environment required for my project is a lightweight library
database that does not need many settings to run. 

The SQLite React Native has created an application for Android where the user can register, update, view, and delete any content from a database,
integrating all knowledge acquired during lectures and research made.


# Prototype

The application was designed to be user-friendly, with easy access buttons and fewer steps to register users. On the home screen, it is possible to access all functions the application offers to users (see Figure 1). Thus, it helps the user go through all functions that the app provides with fewer steps quickly.

Figure 1 Home Screen of application.

The users only need to fill in all details in the registration form and submit it for registration. All inputs in the registration form, first name, last name, gender and department, are the type of text and must be filled in completely, with no blank space. The app offers the possibility to see one specific user with the ID information or see all users. Also, the app provides the option to get the ID user using the user first and last name (see Figure 2).

There is a button that allows the users to update their information on the app. The update screen is functional and allows the user to update all information at the same time. Also, the application has a screen to delete the user information, both when you have the ID number (see Figure 3).

After all commands (registration, delete and update), a successful message is shown on the screen. Also, a message to fill all blank spaces is displayed when the user tries to submit the registration with missing items.
