# SQLiteProject

The hybrid framework React Native is used alongside NodeJS to develop applications mainly in the Android environment,
which enables the running of JavaScript on the server-side on the web environment.

In simple terms, the SQLite functionality in React Native environment required for my project is a lightweight library
database that does not need many settings to run. 

The SQLite React Native has created an application for Android where the user can register, update, view, and delete any content from a database,
integrating all knowledge acquired during lectures and research made.
